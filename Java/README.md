## Owl Java

Some random classes I've written as I was learning Java and reading the course book and material.

There's no real coherence or consistency to any of them, some of them might even be empty as I just created the file and then didn't continue as I had something else to do or I got distracted. Might fill it up with more classes in time, we'll see what happens.
